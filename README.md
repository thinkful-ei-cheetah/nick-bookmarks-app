# user's Bookmarks v1

## API-powered Bookmarks application that allows users to store and rate their custom web bookmarks.

### Known Issues
* Tabbing and selecting elements via Enter key resets focus to beginning of parent element
* Entering an incorret URL does not notify of correct prompt to use. This is mainly due to relying on built-in html input types for form validation.

### Future Features
* Add star icons in place of text in 'Rating'
* Ability to enter user name to update bookmarks list and application title
